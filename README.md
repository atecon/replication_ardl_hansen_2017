# Replication of Bruce E. Hansen's "Time Series Econometrics for the 21st Century", The Journal of Economic Education (2017)

[Link to Abstract and PDF File of Paper](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/papers/jee.html)

[Link to original data and Stata code](https://users.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/progs/jee.zip)

This repo replicates the examples and the Stata code using the open-source econometrics and statistics software [**Gretl**](https://gretl.sourceforge.net/).

This is a 1-to-1 translation of the Stata code. Many steps can be simplified on the Gretl side by means of functions, loops and other commands. Neverthelss, the scripts stay close to the original Stata code. 

**How-to run the example scripts**

Before execution, please adapt the path to your local directory at the beginning of the gretl script:

```gretl
# SET PATH TO FOLDER INCLUDING THE DATASETS, e.g.
set workdir "/home/me/git/replication_ardl_hansen_2017"
```
